QUESTION NO. 2-  
OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT.
ANSWER -
Objects are the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data-types,primitive data-types all store a single value while each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types.
Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

CODE - 
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'BMW';
myCar.model = 'X4';
myCar.year = 2014;
myCar.wheels = 4;
//After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.
//i.e.
console.log(myCar.year)

//Output: 2014

//These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

console.logmyCar['year']

//Output: 2014
